## RUNNING
* Run python test_engine.py

## LEARNINGS

* Work two zone blocks at least every day. Consistent and non linear progress will be made.

* Don't have food in a zone block. Sprite is fine.

* When in doubt start writing unit tests

* how to plot trajectories is the final question since sequence of trajectories keeps changing

* Meditation is awesome. Always code in the zone. IAI.

* Play around using your own intuition also.

* Visualize things as much as you can.

* Start separate repository for gurobi matching.

* Create dataset of randomly moving particles and velocities.

* Create jpda dataset to debug. Show that hungarian fails.

## TODO
* Add node for missing detections
* Add noise to trajectories. 
* Does the hungarian matching actuall perform worse compared to the greedy tracker matching algorithm
